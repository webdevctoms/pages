<p><strong>“Humans are more important than Hardware”</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Quality is better than Quantity"</strong></p>
<p>– two of five Special Forces Truths</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more. CTOMS™ started as a training company, and first and foremost, CTOMS™ remains a training company. We believe that it is essential to first become effectively trained to rely on yourself and not your equipment. We believe it is essential to first become educated in order to make effective equipment choices that will enhance your knowledge and skill, not compensate for a lack thereof. And we believe that when you do choose your equipment, it needs to be best of breed and meet rigorous quality standards.</p>
<p><strong>"You can eat soup with a fork, but only if you have to"</strong></p>
<p>– SF Proverb</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said about the right tool for the right job, but navigating the market and deciphering between fancy marketing and credible data can be daunting. Being a training company first sets our priorities straight; our approach to 'marketing' is education. The decision to bring a product to market is based on requirement, research, data, critical evaluation and common sense. We don't recommend a product because we carry it. We carry it because it is something we would pack in our own personal kit, and rely on with our own lives.</p>
<p><strong>It's not just about Tactical Medicine</strong></p>
<p>The Evolution of Tactical Medicine℠ is the concept that CTOMS™ was founded upon, but we are all a product of our experience. Because our backgrounds are so multifaceted, it was impossible for us to get stuck in the "Tactical Medicine" box. Our passions are rooted in tactical casualty management, and this is where we excel. With that said, you'll see the evolution of our training and products venture beyond this from broad spectrum requirements to niche specialty solutions, within our arcs of experience, but beyond just Tactical Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>What worked yesterday would be fine...if it was yesterday</strong></p>
<p>But today the rules are different. They change fast; they change often. The problems are more complex than ever. Thankfully, today we have more experience, more knowledge, and we just know better. It's our business to provide you with evolutionary new solutions to match this rapidly changing operational environment through education and through equipment innovation.<strong></strong></p>
