	<p>There is a lot to be said about the right tool for the right job, but navigating the market and deciphering between fancy marketing and credible data can be daunting. Being a training company first sets our priorities straight; our approach to 'marketing' is education. The decision to bring a product to market is based on requirement, research, data, critical evaluation, and common sense. We don't recommend a product because we carry it. We carry it because it is something we would pack in our own personal kit, and rely on with our own lives.</p>
