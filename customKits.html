<h4><strong>CTOMS™ has the capability to provide Customize Kits to meet your agency requirements</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Custom Equipment Packages</strong></p>
<p>By grouping together a number of individual products into a kit we can give it one product code to make reordering more convenient for your agency. For example, a “Tactical Officer’s Package” could include a Crye Precision™ AirFrame™ Helmet, Crye Precision™ AVS™, C-Sling™, Fully Stocked SlimmerLine™, etc. Once the kit has been defined, when a new recruit class is run, it simplifies the logistics of equipment procurement for everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>Customized ‘Kits of Convenience’ or 'Procedure Kits' (Health Canada Licensed)</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget to check out our TVAK™ and S.A.S™, etc. These are examples of customized Procedure Kits that we produce. If you want a TVAK™ with a specific gauge angiocatheter, or even if you want a completely different procedure kit, such as a Blood Transfusion Kit, Chest Tube Kit, Urinary Catheterization Kit, we can custom package and Health Canada License them to meet your specific needs. Minimum quantity order commitments will apply.</p>
