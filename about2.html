<p><strong>– two of five Special Forces Truths</strong></p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more. CTOMS™ started as a training company, and first and foremost, CTOMS™ remains a training company. We believe that it is essential to first become effectively trained to rely on yourself and not your equipment. We believe it is essential to first become educated in order to make effective equipment choices that will enhance your knowledge and skill, not compensate for a lack thereof. And we believe that when you do choose your equipment, it needs to be best of breed and meet rigorous quality standards.</p>

<p><strong>– SF Proverb</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot to be said about the right tool for the right job, but navigating the market and deciphering between fancy marketing and credible data can be daunting. Being a training company first sets our priorities straight; our approach to 'marketing' is education. The decision to bring a product to market is based on requirement, research, data, critical evaluation, and common sense. We don't recommend a product because we carry it. We carry it because it is something we would pack in our own personal kit, and rely on with our own lives.</p>
